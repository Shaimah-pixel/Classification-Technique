# Classification-Technique
In this project, I applied classification technique.
The dataset was split into training and test sets. 
Various classification algorithms, such as, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM were explored to determine which method provided the best accuracy for this particular dataset.
Logistic regression is not performed as the class is not binary.
I have utilized evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix to assess the model's performance. Additionally, techniques like feature selection was employed to enhance the model's predictive capability.

Conclusion: The classification model demonstrated promising results in accurately predicting the target classes. Based on the evaluation metrics, we found that Decision Tree and Random Forest performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 91% and 94%. The model's precision and recall were also balanced, indicating good performance in both classifying positive and negative cases.
However SVM, KNN and NB gave average performance with an accuracy of 60%. Along with XG Boost, the accuracy acieved was 97%.
Performing Feature Selection and dropping non-significant column gave an accuracy of 96% with Random Forest technique.
